ETHSecurity Resources
=========================

## What to do

Add a uri to the list below which points to any type of security resource you feel is relevant to the ETHSecurity community, and PR your change. This can be of any type such as blogs or specific articles, lists, repos, tools, audit reports, etc etc. Resource examples are the ToB repo, Consensys repos, any publicly realeased audits, etc. If the resource is an offline file you'd like to uploade directly then PR that too.

## Workshop Info
Security Resources Workshop is scheduled at 1500 on Thursday, September 6th at the ETHSecurity Unconference
